# An Action is a class representing a single task. It's an implementation of the "command" pattern,
# comparable to the Interactors gem. Unlike Interactors, however, Actions are based om ActiveModel,
# and are expected to raise an exception when they fail.
#
# ## Why Not Interactors?
#
# Interactors implement a monadic error handling mechanism, which is cool but makes interop with
# other Ruby code rather difficult. Interactors also rely on a shared "context" namespace for
# both passing arguments and returning results.
#
# # Implementing an Action
#
# To implement an action, create a new file in the `app/actions` directory, and create a subclass of
# `Action`. Generally, this will be in verb form (think `ResetPassword` or `CancelOrder`). Add any
# parameter declarations with the DSL, any validations (all ActiveModel validations should work!),
# and a `#call` method. If you want to return something from an Action, return a Hash which will be
# wrapped in an OpenStruct. For example:
#
#   class ResetPassword < Action
#     parameter :email, required: true
#
#     def call
#       { delivery: UserMailer.reset_password(email).deliver_now }
#     end
#   end
#
# # Calling an Action
#
# Action classes act like Procs which take a Hash as a parameter (defined by the `parameter` calls
# in the DSL) and return a Struct-like object. To use an Action, simply `.call()` them, like this:
#
#   ResetPassword.call(email: 'help@yuuapp.com')
#
# One thing to note is that any unknown parameters are silently ignored.
class Action
  include ActiveModel::Model
  include DSL

  def initialize(obj)
    # Slice our input to just the necessary attributes
    super(obj.stringify_keys.slice(*attribute_names))
  end

  def self.call(obj)
    result = new(obj).tap(&:validate!).call

    result.is_a?(Hash) ? OpenStruct.new(result) : result
  end

  # @return [Hash] The context of this Action
  def context
    attribute_names.map { |k| [k, public_send(k)] }.to_h
  end

  # Alias for ActiveModel
  alias_method :attributes, :context

  # TODO: replace with `ActiveModel#validate!`
  def validate!
    raise ValidationError, self unless valid?
  end
end
